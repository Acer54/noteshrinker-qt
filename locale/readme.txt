If you want to help translating this application in more languages, get in contact with me via git or my [homepage](http://my-darling.is-a-linux-user.org)

 * You will get a *.ts file with the latest GUI-Strings which are in use
 * You can create a translation file with "Qt-Linguist", which is included in the package "pyqt4-dev-tools"
 * You send the finalized translation file (*.qm) to me back again,
 * I will implement the file in this git-repository

Thanks for your help in advance
